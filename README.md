# Julia Programming Language Notes
This repo contains all the notes that I would like to remember about Julia Programming Language and can be used by anyone

# Getting Started
- In order to use Julia, you need to install it from the official Julia page [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the steps.
- If you already have Jupyter downloaded then you will not have to download it again

# What to Expect
This repo will provide basic, intermediate as well as advanced understanding of the things found in Julia. It will also include simple projects using Julia and ML projects using Julia


# UPDATE
This repo is currently not being updated for the time being. It shall however be updated once the maintainer has enough time
