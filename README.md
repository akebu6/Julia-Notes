# Julia-Notes
This repo contains all the notes that I would like to remember about Julia Programming Language and can be used by anyone

# Getting Started
- In order to use Julia, you need to install it from the official Julia page [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the steps.
- If you already have Jupyter downloaded then you will not have to download it again
